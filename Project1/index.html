    <h2 class="one">About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Joseph Curto; I am a Senior at the University of North Florida studying Computing and Information Science. I was born in Oklahoma City in 1997 and moved here to Jacksonville Fl, in 2003.<br> Growing up I enjoyed going to Kona
        Skatepark with my dad, the beach, and the amuesment parks down in Orlando.
    </p>
    <p> Not until I built my first PC nearly two years ago did I have an interest in learning how to program. As of right now, two years later, I am proficient in Java, intermediate in Python and C# and now learning about web development. Some other facts
        about myself are that I enjoy 90's hip-hop, and present day indie music. Some of my favorite artists are "A Tribe Called Quest", "Nas", "Courtney Barnett" and "Stella Donnelly".
    </p>
    <h2 class="two">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Aside from programming, in my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy novels, such as Lord of the Rings and Dune.<br> In addition, I enjoy playing videogames, primarily FPS and strategy PC games such as
        <a class="Overwatch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)" target="_blank">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War:_Warhammer_II" target="_blank">Total War: Warhammer II</a> with nintendo coming
        in a close second.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I enjoy exercising.<br> Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end can take a tole on your physical and mental health, as well as your posture, so I try and make it a point to exercise four times a week to prevent such things.<br>        One of my most recent interests includes learning how to solder with my mom. We both are starting out with a cheap alarm clock kit to get use to it then we will be moving onto working with the GPIO pins of my Raspberry Pi Zero W.
    </p>
    <h2 class="three">Education</h2>
    <p>
        During my first semester of college I attended, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University" target="_blank">Florida Atlantic University</a> to study Marine Biology, however I struggled to make friends and didn't like being
        so far away from my family, so I chose to move back to Jacksonville, where I transfered to the University of North Florida. Since trasfering and growing up, my interests have changed which resulted in me changing majors. I have moved from Marine
        Biology, to Business Management, English, Criminal Justice to now Computer Science which I can say I truly enjoy. I ended up settling with Computer Science because to my genuine interest as well as the challenge. The previous majors posed minimal
        challenge, and I feared future employment in those fields would be little to none.</p>
    <p>
        When it comes to my educational goals, one of them is beat my dad's GPA of 3.49 that he recieved from Ohio State University. Ever since seeing his transcript from 1978, I have decided that I want to show him up so do speak. If I am to get a better GPA
        then my dad, I would accomplish another one of my goals, that being graduating with honors. I know that GPA doesn't really matter outside of academia however, I am just wanting to do it to prove to myself that I can. Furthermore, I hope to get
        on the deans list a total of four times before graduation. As of right now, I have gotten on the deans list a total of three times, so one more to go.
    </p>
